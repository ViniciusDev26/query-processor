 * Pushes selection operations down the tree as far as possible.

 * This is a heuristic optimization that reduces the number of tuples

 *
 * Strategy:
 * 1. If we have a Selection on top of a Projection, push Selection below
 * 2. If we have consecutive Selections, keep them together (naturally at the bottom)
 * 3. Selections should be as close to Relations as possible
 *
 * Examples:
 * - σ[cond](π[attrs](R)) → π[attrs](σ[cond](R))
 * - σ[c1](σ[c2](R)) → σ[c1](σ[c2](R)) (already optimal)
 * - σ[cond](R) → σ[cond](R) (already optimal)
